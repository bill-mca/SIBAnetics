Title: Group Build Design Criteria
---

# Introduction
This document is intended to be a record of the ideas that we have discussed for our group build project.
The Proposals section contains specific ideas for what could be built. The Constraints section details the design constraints for our project: both those stipulated b the course and those set internally by team members. The Ideals section is a collection of value statements: messages or themes that we would like to address with our maker project. The constraints are mandatory and we expect our final project to meet all of them. The ideals are optional and we would like our maker project to express some of them. In the interest of a comprehensible message for our demo day presentation, we expect that we will need to choose a small set of ideals to focus on.
