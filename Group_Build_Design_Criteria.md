Title: Group Build Design Criteria
---

# Introduction
This document is intended to be a record of the ideas that we have discussed for our group build project.
The Proposals section contains specific ideas for what could be built. The Constraints section details the design constraints for our project: both those stipulated b the course and those set internally by team members. The Ideals section is a collection of value statements: messages or themes that we would like to address with our maker project. The constraints are mandatory and we expect our final project to meet all of them. The ideals are optional and we would like our maker project to express some of them. In the interest of a comprehensible message for our demo day presentation, we expect that we will need to choose a small set of ideals to focus on.

# Proposals

## Personal Language Model ü¶≠üà∂
Learns to understand your handwriting and the idiosyncrasies of your writing. Can generate messages as though they were written by you like in the movie *Her* (it's not a super original idea). Also tells you what you need to do to improve your handwriting and cut back the idiosyncrasies in your writing. It would allow you to practice handwriting a lot more oftem as it would be quite effective at digitizing your writing so you would be able to draft all your work in hand writing before digitizing to edit.

### Message
IDK

### Ideals
 1. (AT) Is story-driven
 6. (SPN) Respecting diversity
 8. (IL) Is about ways of communicating / That context is part of meaning-making
 10. (SPN) Question the scalability
 11. (SPN) Context drives scalability
 12. (BM) Eudaimonic AI that pushes humans to be better rather than allowing us to cut corners
 15. (BM) Computer vision

### Demo day
I think that the personal language model would be a bit lame on demo day because people would have to spend a it of time handwriting something like *the quick brown fox...* so that the model had enough of your data to start working.

## Sign Language Computer Interface ü´∞üñ•
[Plenty of work has been done](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11831-019-09384-2) on using AI to translate sign language. This would be using sign language as an interface to a computer so that you can interact with the computer by moving your body instead of sitting still. This is, however, still a symbolic interface to your computer. 

![Kinect data visualization example](https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExaXB0NjNscnd3NHJlOHZ1bGhoOHN5bndjaGRhcDYwZ205Y3VzYWp1OSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/jh9FGY437Fd04/giphy.webp)

I think the [X-Box Kinect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect) might have already had this kind of interface to some of its software. I did a bit of research and found that it is called a Natural Interface and there is an open-source SDK called [OpenNI](https://wiki.ros.org/openni). We could buy an old X-Box Kinect off ebay for less than $30 and make a novel Natural Interface.

### Message
That in the future we will be able to interact with computers in physical ways.

## Hippocampus Filing System üåäüèáüóÉ
The way we store documents on our computers is a skewmorph of the way it was done when people used to write stuff down on dead trees üìÉ. I waste a lot of time trying to find documents in my own computer's filing system and when I have shared folders with other people it gets really confusing. On the other hand, I can remember where places are very well. I've been able to look at maps of cities that I visited, for a few days 5 years ago, and still remember all the places I went and the streets that I walked. If you were able to store your digital files in your physical environment as an augmented reality overlay, it'd be a lot easier to find stuff especially if there'd been a long time since you last retrieved it. There is evidence that spatial cognition and memory occurs in the [hippocampus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus#Function) and is quite different from other abstract forms of thought.

This idea isn't super original because there are various tools that allow you to organise geotagged photos this way. Extending it to other types of media and making the location arbitrary wrt composition is nove but might also greatly reduce the utility.

### Message
Computers can be designed to better enable human's to realise their full capability. 

### Ideals
 1. (AT) Is story-driven
 5. (BM) Critical making: the invention, and the making of it, helps us to reflect on current technological paradigms and our own worldviews
 6. (SPN) Respecting diversity
 7. (AT) Physicality in Virtual systems
 8. (IL) Is about ways of communicating / That context is part of meaning-making
 10. (SPN) Question the scalability
 11. (SPN) Context drives scalability

### Components
- (physical) The only physical component is the geography of planet earth.
- (ML) I don't know what ML it would use.

### Demo day
You could get people to play with a world map and a complex file structure to see the contrast but you wouldn't be able to give people a direct experience.

## Ento-meteorology üêúüå¶
Using cameras to collect time-lapse images of ant colonies. Machine learning would look for patterns in the behaviour of the ants or the structure of their colonies. It would relate this to time-series weather data. The idea is that the model would learn to forecast the weather based on the behaviour of ants. I've heard that ants prepare their nests for heavy rain by building levees around the openings. 

### Message
That there are patterns in the natural world that we do not, and might never, understand. Connectionist AI can help to open us to the counter-intuitive and mysterious in the natural world.

## Waving Tube Man üï∫üêô

The idea is to make a [waving tube man](https://www.skydancersaustralia.com.au/Sky-Dancers-Products/pink-fan-with-man), wire him up to a neural network and get him to learn to move his body in an intentional way. It would probably be too hard, but the ideal would be to make him throw and catch frisbees. Getting him to block frisbees and change the periodicity of his waving to match the tempo of ambient music might be achievable. 

![Waving Tube Man](https://media2.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExenBwbWhvN2F3ajVib2RhYjg4MTI1cDk5Njc1bzNvdHZtdTlramU1ayZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/3oriOfe0A84SVqwr6w/giphy.webp)

The project would allow us to muck around with lots of different structures of neural nets as we would spend most of our time experimenting with different designs of neural nets and trying to use them to get the tube man to "understand" his own body and move in an intentional way. There might be some complicated physial making to build a tube man design that can move in either a random or an intentional way.

The cool part would be training him to move in an intentional way. Once we had something that moved in a non-deterministic way and a camera trained on it, we'd need to get the actuators to be able to assert imperfect control over the motion of the body. From there, we would add neural nets and let them work for hours watching what happens as they fiddle with different sequences of signals sent to the actuators. Hopefully, the neural net would be able to identify some patterns. For example; if you tighten the left side cord and turn off the blower, the tube man flops down to the left. If you then turn the blower on full power, he leaps up making a 90 degree arc.

We'd use computer vision to map the trajectory of incoming projectiles and the neaural net would be set the goal of maximising the chance of an intercept. To make it more simple, the tube man might just be able to watch the incoming projectile and gradually lean left/right to align his head with it and execute a block.

I got the idea from a [lecture by Manuel DeLanda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC57sUilp44) where he joked that you could link a neural network up to some sensors and train it to catch a frisbee. He went on to talk about how, in his philosophy, matter is fundamentally creative and that higher levels of emergent phenomena (biology, consciousness) work by directing natural emergence from the chaos of lower levels. A tube man's movement is typically chaotic. My idea is that, using the neural net, he will learn to direct the chaos so that his movement is a blend of intentionality and randomness. I reckon it'll freak people out if we can teach him to (sometimes) catch frisbees üòÇ They'll initially percieve it as a bizzare coincidence but then they'll see him do it multiple times. 

These concepts are also part of it:
- [Soft-bodied robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_robotics) is a field of research partly motivated to make robots safer for kids to play with
- Chaos theory / far from equilibrium thermodynamics
- Non-linear materialism

### Message
That consciousess emerges from the body. That connectionist AI is a unique tool that will change the way we percieve the world. 

### Ideals
 2. (IL) Alluring
 3. (IL) Funny
 4. (AT) Biomimetics
 5. (BM) Critical making: the invention, and the making of it, helps us to reflect on current technological paradigms and our own worldviews
 6. (SPN) Respecting diversity
 7. (AT) Physicality in virtual systems
 9. (SPN) Participatory
 11. (SPN) Context drives scalability
 14. (BM) Gives insight into the emergence of consciousness
 15. (BM) Computer vision
 16. (BM) A really fun and interactive presentation for demo day
 17. (BM) Something for demo day that makes people move around
 19. (Nobody) Make our project a parody of conventional robotics

### Components
- (sensor) Computer vision; maybe with depth perception to make him better at blocking projectiles
- (sensor) optionally, some proprioception to see if that makes him move better
- (sensor) optionally, a microphone to listen for music to dance to
- (actuator) blowers, fans, pumps, valves, etc. to animate his body
- (actuator) optionally, little cords that can be wound / unwound by motors
- (physical) a non-rigid body that moves in a non-deterministic way
- (machine learning) A neural network that translates patterns of sensor data into patterns of actuation that achieve goals
     
### MVP
For the MVP we could just make a bot that moves up and down a rail and can block a tennis ball that is rolled towards it. It would use a camera as a sensor and the machine learning would kinda be redundant because the problem would be quite deterministic ü§∑

For the MVP +1  we could build a non-rigid arm that is swung around by a servo motor and tries to block incoming projectiles. The arm could be made in miniature from readily available motors and a couple of 3D printed segments. The idea being that the intentional movement is mediated by some non-deterministic part which the neural net has to learn to control.

### Demo Day
It would be a really fun presentation on demo day because people would be able to interact with the tube man by throwing different projectiles for him to block/catch. They could also change the song that he is dancing to. You could also potentially demo different versions of the neural net that demonstrate what tube man was like while he was still learning to control his body. 

## Wayward Robot Refuge ü§ñ

This project has a similar message to the tube man idea above. Inspired by that scene from Bladerunner, we would make several eccentric robots with a diversity of structures. We'd link each up to a neural network and teach it to move in an intentional way. 

![Group of Eccentric Robots](https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExenQzMWhxdjU3OXljOHltenBweHNrdmdmMjJpM3hhbzRjNmUwemphMyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/11cs0cHw6WnoFa/giphy.webp)

The cool thing about this one is that the MVP should be a lot easier than the tube man. It still requires us to use neural networks and probably computer vision too.

**Here are some concepts of robots that move in unusual ways:**

![Snake Bot](https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbnJld3FlM3FhN3hpZXkxbXU2aWV4d2VrODg2dDA1N3NoY2g2ajl3cSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/QqDNojdvH30wYs8V3K/giphy.webp)

### Message
Robots don't have to be bipedal. That consciousness can emerge from all kinds of body structures. 

### Components
- (sensor) Computer vision; I reckon a camera above that can control all the bots in the room with a god's eye view
- (sensor) optionally, some proprioception to see if that makes them move better
- (sensor) optionally, some sort of wireless sensor to allow us to call them together or disperse them
- (actuator) servos, motors, [muscle wire](https://core-electronics.com.au/muscle-wire-0-005-diameter-1-foot.html) etc.
- (physical) several unusual bodies
- (physical) optionally, A body that moves in a non-deterministic way
- (machine learning) A neural network that translates patterns of sensor data into patterns of actuation to make each bot move in purposefully.

Two bots that have learnt to move through neural networks. 

![Milk Carton Bot](https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExb3cwdDllZWhjOGZ3Y3JoNGNvand0bDVvdnNlZW82YjRqczJ3MTFwZiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/lj11uKKMhr4Os/giphy.webp)

### Demo Day
Ideally there would be a room full of lots of weird robots scrambling around. When you walk near one of them it screams out and all the other ones trun and run towards you. Not all the robots are equally capable. Some of them move very slowly and some can't move in a chosen direction at all.

## DIY Neural Network Kit üß†

I was surprised to discover that there are no kits available to build your own Perceptron! Surely this would be a good educational activity? To give people a tangible experience of wiring up a small neural network and then watching it learn to solve a simple problem.

![Rosenblatt with the Perceptron](https://media-assets.wired.it/photos/657842036249f6225e48bd01/16:9/w_1600,c_limit/107644525.jpeg)

We would repurpose [cheap microcontrollers](https://core-electronics.com.au/seeeduino-xiao-arduino-microcontroller-samd21-cortex-m0.html) to perform as nodes in a perceptron. We'd design them so that they could take up to four inputs and pass up to four outputs. Each neuron would have LEDs to indicate its status and whether it is recieving input from each connection. We'd have to design interfaces for either end. The input might be done with some custom software for a Raspberry Pi. The output might be able to be done with a simpler interface maybe just a few lights and buttons. 

 - Would we be able to set it up to do back propogation?
 - How many neurons would we need to make it interesting?
 - How much would a neuron cost?

It would be a tangible educational tool teaching the same concepts as Tensor Flow's [Neural Network Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org).

### Message
That neural networks are a distinct form of computing that can perform inductive reasoning. Binary computer atchitectures can do deductive reasoning. This project will make an educational kit and a set of activities that help people to understand neural networks.

### Components
- (sensor) The raspberry pi input device will be transorming sensing data into a simple format for the network. 
- (sensor) buttons at the output for training
- (actuator) lights to allow users to understand the operation of the network
- (actuator) optionally, can attach the ouput to some actuator to demonstrate neural networks in robotics
- (physical) a network of neurons that can be re-arranged by users
- (machine learning) it's a bloody neural network! üòÅ

### Ideals
 2. (IL) Alluring
 4. (AT) Biomimetics
 5. (BM) Critical making: the invention, and the making of it, helps us to reflect on current technological paradigms and our own worldviews
 6. (SPN) Respecting diversity
 7. (AT) Physicality in Virtual systems
 9. (SPN) Participatory
 12. (BM) Eudaimonic AI that pushes humans to be better rather than allowing us to cut corners
 14. (BM) Gives insight into the emergence of consciousness
 16. (BM) A really fun and interactive presentation for demo day
 17. (BM) Something for demo day that makes people move around

### MVP
Four neurons wired together and an input interface.

### Demo Day
Set up as a robotics classroom and people are encouraged to try reconfiguring the network to solve a problem. If the neurons are cheap and easy to make we might be able to have a couple of networks going at the same time to allow many people to cooperate.
