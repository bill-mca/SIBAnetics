Title: Group Build Design Criteria
---

# Introduction
This document is intended to be a record of the ideas that we have discussed for our group build project.
The Proposals section contains specific ideas for what could be built. The Constraints section details the design constraints for our project: both those stipulated b the course and those set internally by team members. The Ideals section is a collection of value statements: messages or themes that we would like to address with our maker project. The constraints are mandatory and we expect our final project to meet all of them. The ideals are optional and we would like our maker project to express some of them. In the interest of a comprehensible message for our demo day presentation, we expect that we will need to choose a small set of ideals to focus on.

# Constraints
<!--
I can't find the official marking criteria anywhere! It'd be good to write up the course constraints directly from the official marking criteria. For now I've just written what I could remember.  
-->
 - (course) Must present a convincing prototype on Demo Day
 - (course) Project must be delivered within a $500 budget
 - (course) Must include a physical component
 - (course) The physical component must be built by us
 - (course) Must include a machine-learning component
 - (course) Must include cyber component
 - (Bill) Must not be labour-saving device

# Ideals
 - (Bill) Eudaimonic AI that pushes humans to be better rather than allowing us to cut corners
 - (Bill) A message about the unpredictability of emergent phenomena 
 
# Proposals

## Personal Language Model
Learns to understand your handwriting and the idiosyncrasies of your writing. Can generate messages as though they were written by you like in the movie *Her* (it's not a super original idea). Also tells you what you need to do to improve your handwriting and cut back the idiosyncrasies in your writing. It would allow you to practice handwriting a lot more oftem as it would be quite effective at digitizing your writing so you would be able to draft all your work in hand writing. before digitizing to edit.

## Sign Language Computer Interface
[Plenty of work has been done](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11831-019-09384-2) on using AI to translate sign language. This would be using sign language as an interface to a computer so that you can interact with the computer by moving your body instead of sitting still. 

I think the [X-Box Kinect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect) might have already had this kind of interface to some of its software. I did a bit of research and found that it is called a Natural Interface and there is an open-source SDK called [OpenNI](https://wiki.ros.org/openni). We could buy an old X-Box Kinect off ebay for less than $30 and make a novel Natural Interface.
