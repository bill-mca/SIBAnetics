# TEAM MEETING #X

This meeting confirms our final idea, begins brainstorming process on the MVP, and establishes administrative processes and further action.


##Final Decision:
Lip reading hearing aid
- Possibly including swarm technology as a way to triangulate cameras and microphones to hone in on the subject

##MVP
- Will build prototype using Raspberry Pi
  - Possibility of advancing to writing a phone app (if time and capacity allows)
- Using Whisper actively to take in all talking in the room, and then using lip-reading to hone in on the actual subject that needs to be understood by the user
- Investigate using a projector to project output so the room, and not just the user wearing the wearable, can see the output
- Movie
  - POV with background noise throughout
  - When someone is interacting with the prototype, their output is focussed as the "conversation" this person is having (to emulate how the prototype should function in the real world context)
  - Glasses in the foreground, overlay on a shadowed clubbing/social background
  - Output will manifest as text in one of the lens
  - The visual will be exported as live animated PNG, and will use FFMPEG on the day to incorporate text and visual in real time

##Admin and Process
- Set regular meetings
  - Tuesday 6 August: update on initial work, preliminary discussion on supply chain lifecycle
  - Thursday 15 August: second sprint to work on pitch
- Set sprint days
  - Even when we are responsible for a particular "station", we will come together to explain/teach what we've done
- Create roadmap
  - Use Amanda's Gantt chart template
    - The Gantt chart will be vague on the final outcome, noting it is a live document
    - We will revisit the Gantt chart after assessment/milestones/sprints to solidify next steps

##To do
- Create video overlay template by Tuesday 6 August
- Investigate APIs on HuggingFace
