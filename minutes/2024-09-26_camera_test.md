# CPS Sprint - Camera Testing
Today we connected Amanda's Raspberry Pi to a Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2. Bill was able to teach us how to use the Raspberry Pi, and provided the testing code from his Cybernetic Stream Table project.

## Camera Test
We cloned Bill's Cybernetic Stream Table git to the Raspberry Pi. We then used one of the camera test commands to ascertain whether the camera module works as intended.

### Test Code

tom@raspberrypi:~ $ cd cybernetic-stream-table/
tom@raspberrypi:~/cybernetic-stream-table $ cat ssh_commands.sh
tom@raspberrypi:~.cybernetic-stream-table $ libcamera-jpeg --qt-preview on -o test.jpg

### Test Outcome
PS Don't forget Bhuthu!!
