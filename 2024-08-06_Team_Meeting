# TEAM MEETING #X
This meeting expands on our CPS Project idea, and tasks our next steps before our Design Brief on 20 August 2024.

## MVP
- Tentative: a mask with cameras in the eyes for people to interact with
  - Camera will be used to capture video
  - Video will be fed to ML model for lip-reading
  - Video will also be fed to monitor/project, externalising what the user of the product should be seeing
    - The video will be of a live feed of the room in the background, overlay with glasses. Lip-reading caption will appear on one of the lenses in real time.
- Tentative: a separate video that speaks to the CPS
- Tentative: a pair of glasses with camera and microphone(?) attached to show people what the product may look like
