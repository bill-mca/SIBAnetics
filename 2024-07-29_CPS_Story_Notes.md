DIY Neural Network Kit. 		1	Bill likes this the best. Microcontroller kit.  3 or 4 stations - tensor flow playground vs one station unlearning your ontology. We are building physical neural network made of microcontrollers.  		Beyond that we are building an educational kit.  What are the sensors and actuators?  Solve a real world problem.  \

Bill:\
1.  Neural Net: Passionate about the philosophy - may be difficult to demonstrate\
2.  Speech to text - because it\'92s a wearable it may be limited.  Risky MVP - Advantage - clear positive message\
3.  Wayward Robot - easy to demonstrate MVP within reach \'97 downside is the message.  What is the message. \

1	I love the idea of learning something new.  Risky MVP \
2	Visual.  Good message.  Doable?\
3 	Robot fun/alluring, but message?\

1	Neural net \'97 educational aspect very cool  Struggling to understand the complexity.  The messaging will need to be crafted well.  Could integrate the wayward robot.\
2	Speech to text - good story singular message.  Worry about demo day:  One person interacting with the piece.  Possibly awkward.\
3	Wayward Robot - combine the two could be good.  Within Grasp.  The message is a bit vague.\

Izak:\
1	NN	Several different kinds.  Kits.  This is good.  A perceptron is easier to digest.  Different types of perceptron.  Can combine with wayward robots.  Older demographic may not want to engage with it.\
	Have a fear that the audience will be an older audience.  They may know about neural networks.  We need to decide an audience.  \
2.	Whisper net - very feasible.  You could have a wearable and a random.  Maybe one screen that combines random person - regardless of what you are doing it is a spyware.   People are engaged in the room, even though they are not engaged with any of us personally.  \
3.	Wayward Robot Refuge.  People can watch the chaos or non-chaos play out.  Referencing swarm science is really cool.  I reckon the message is about emergence from interactions amongst diverse actors.  The message is about emergence from interactions amongst diverse actors.  \
